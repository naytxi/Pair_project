üñêÔ∏è Hi! I'm Nay and I'm currently learning to code.

<h2>üöÄABOUT </h2>

This is the the first pair project of the Fullstack Bootcamp at Pe√±ascalF5 with Html and Css.
In this project, each pair of students will work together to create an exact replica of a given landing page using only HTML and CSS.
This exercise will help you deepen your understanding of HTML structure, CSS styling, and responsive design principles.

<p> 
  
**Analyze the Original Page:** Start by examining the layout, colors, fonts, and spacing of the landing page provided. Pay attention to details like margins, paddings, and alignment to ensure accuracy in your replication.
  
**Divide the Work:** Each team member should take responsibility for different parts of the page, such as the header, main content, footer, and any additional elements. Plan together to ensure consistency in style and coding practices.

**Build with HTML:** Create the HTML structure, focusing on semantic tags and clear class naming. Make sure each section is set up correctly for styling.

**Style with CSS:** Apply CSS to match the colors, fonts, layout, and responsiveness of the original page. Use media queries to ensure the page looks good on various screen sizes.

**Final Review and Refinement:** Once the page is complete, review it together and compare it to the original. Make adjustments as needed to achieve an accurate match.</p>

‚úàÔ∏è Welcome to my journey.
